How to contribute
*****************

File bug reports or feature requests, and make contributions
(e.g. code patches), by opening a "new issue" on GitHub:

- PeirPy Issues: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Probabilistic-Peridynamics/issues

Please give as much information as you can in the ticket. It is extremely
useful if you can supply a small self-contained code snippet that reproduces
the problem. Also specify the version you are referring to.
